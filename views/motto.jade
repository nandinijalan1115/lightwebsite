                      | Education is a basic human right and a significant factor in the development of children, communities and countries. Opening classroom doors to all children will help break the intergenerational chain of poverty because education is intrinsically linked to all development goals, such as supporting gender empowerment, health , reducing hunger, economic growth and building peace.
                      br
                      | Today, education remains an inaccessible right for millions of children around the world. More than 72 million children of primary education age are not in school and 759 million adults are illiterate and do not have the awareness necessary to improve both their living conditions and those of their children. Standing between these children and the classroom is Poverty and Lack of awareness.
                      br
                      | The main area to make an impact is rural and underprivileged section where education is inaccessible to children. As these sections contribute to major part of illiteracy in world.We believe that youths can change the present scenario of Education by implementing their ideas and Innovative ways from their Vivid brain. Enthusiasm and efforts of youth can bring LIGHT of hope to the lives of these children. One of GYWS' prime projects is Jagriti Vidya Mandir, an English-medium school in Gopali, which aims to provide education to children from underprivileged backgrounds. Established in 2008, the school currently has students studying from Nursery to Class V. Its main motto is to educate each and every child for a better tomorrow.

Youths are most active people, occupy major part of society and they play a vital role in politics, economic development and social movements. Extent of development of society is dependent on the number of empowered youth.

                    | According to studies, youth constitute 18% of the global population, i.e about 1.1 billion in number.Amongst this number approximately 238 million youth live in extreme poverty and more than 73 million are unemployed.Addressing youth unemployment and underemployment has become a priority for Governments worldwide.

                    | To fight against this situation of youth, LIGHT is trying to connect empowered youths for Youth upliftment. To cope up with the problem of unemployment, we can share our skills, so as to make them capable enough to earn jobs and to rise above the poverty. Due to lack of information sources, government policies for youth upliftment cannot reach needy person. Thus we can put forward our steps to create awareness about this policy and we can give them an opportunity to contribute toward Nation's development.

                    | Prayas initiative of Gopali Youth Welfare Society focused on Youth Upliftment. Prayas is providing skill training to local youths so that they can rise above unemployment and learn various skills to earn jobs. Parallel to skill development, Prayas is focused to Connect the youth to the government by awakening them about government policies.

                    | Globally, women have fewer opportunities for economic participation than men, less access to basic and higher education, greater health and safety risks, and less political representation. Guaranteeing the rights of women and giving them opportunities to reach their full potential is critical not only for attaining gender equality, but also for meeting a wide range of international development goals. Empowered women and girls contribute to the health and productivity of their families, communities, and countries, creating a ripple effect that benefits everyone.

                    | It's quite obvious today that root cause of the ground level problems in our society is social unawareness. Most of the welfare schemes and financial schemes of the government and other social organisations are practically inaccessible to the unprivileged. Voice against social evils of child labour and girl suppression is yet not loud enough amongst the weaker sections. Prevalent issues like child marriage, suicides and rapes still pose a threat to the society.

                    | Following the words of Helen Keller, alone we can do so little; together we can do so much, we aim to form a network of autonomous self-sufficient student-run centres across India that will address the local problems and act selflessly to achieve the L8 objectives for a better world.

                    | Under our initiative, we wish to share and exchange ideas, models of working and innovations of our program with already functional social student groups or NGOs as well as newly formed teams . This makes our concept of social service highly interactive and progressive because of the fact that the collaborated NGOs have better local understanding. We not only provide guidance to the associate members , but also wonderful social exposure. We have also planned for the execution of a global social seminar.
